#Snippet workflow for Alfred 3

###Usage
`snip snippetname:snippet`

###Notes
Multiline snippets *DO* work, you just need to paste them into alfred as alfred wont allow you to press enter while adding a snippet.

The default database for snippets in alfred 3 is

`~/Library/Application Support/Alfred 3/Databases/snippets.alfdb"`

The collection used by this script is Snips which is the default collection Alfred uses.
